# snakesForTest
The second version of snake, just for test for the final version. It was upgraded so much from the old one from the server to the UI.
<br>
New functions to improve the experience:
  + Has time count down now.
  + Has 3 2 1 start.
  + Can stay at old room.
  + Can show the number of rounds you played and the number of wins of each side.
  + After a player losed the game, will have an alert to inform to both sides.
  + And a customized asking box for wanting to play again or not. This box is unique as it can show <br>
  to another side when the first side has accepted the playAgain invitation from the server to help the second player knows and increase <br>
  the ability to keep playing. And when a player cancel the invitation, the another one will be sent out the game too by the system,
  to not let the second accepts the invitation and wait for the quited one. 
<br>
Some lacking functions:
  + a profile to customize the information
  + the ability to show all the rooms, with the players's state showing on it, can participate with the join room button.
  + the ranks, the exp, add friends, a lot...
